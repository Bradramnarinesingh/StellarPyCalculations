# Stellar Clusters and Cepheids Data Analysis

This repository includes Python projects aimed at analyzing stellar clusters and applying the Leavitt Law to Cepheids within the Milky Way and a hypothetical galaxy referred to as "Galaxy X". These projects offer insights into the distribution of open and globular clusters within our galaxy, explore the properties of Milky Way Cepheids, and estimate distances to Cepheid variable stars in Galaxy X using the Leavitt Law.

## Projects Overview

- **Stellar Clusters Analysis**: Analyzes the galactic coordinates of open and globular clusters to understand their distribution within the Milky Way.
- **Leavitt Law for Milky Way Cepheids**: Utilizes the Leavitt Law to study the properties of Cepheids in the Milky Way.
- **Distance Estimation for Galaxy X Cepheids**: Applies the Leavitt Law to estimate the distances of Cepheid stars in Galaxy X.

## Dependencies

To run these projects, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy
